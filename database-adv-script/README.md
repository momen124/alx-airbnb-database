# Unleashing Advanced Querying Power

## 📚 About the Project
This project focuses on advanced SQL querying and performance optimization. It simulates real-world data challenges to help you build scalable, efficient, and production-ready SQL solutions.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master advanced SQL queries: JOINs, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions.
- Optimize performance using `EXPLAIN`, indexing, and query refactoring.
- Implement partitioning for scalable data management.
- Monitor and refine database performance like a true DBA.

## ✅ Requirements
- Solid SQL fundamentals and relational database knowledge.
- Git/GitHub repo management.
- Familiarity with PostgreSQL performance tools (`EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`).

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- **Joins & Subqueries:** Write and combine complex SQL logic.
- **Window Functions:** Perform advanced ranking and analytics.
- **Indexing:** Create and test indexes for performance boosts.
- **Query Optimization:** Refactor inefficient queries for speed.
- **Partitioning:** Split large tables for faster access.
- **Monitoring:** Use tools to assess and improve database health.
